# Contributing to TSON-DB

## General

TSON-DB follows [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow), which is a light-weight branch-based collaboration workflow. If you have access to this repository, make sure to not commit to the `main` branch directly. There is no `develop` branch or anything, so just target the `main` branch in a pull request &mdash; unless you want to contribute to someone elseâ€™s work, of course.

### Useful commands

```sh
npm run build # to type-check and build the project once
npm run watch # to watch changes to the project and type-check and build on every change
```

## Formatting

Always format your code using Prettier before requesting a merge. A `.prettierrc.yml` is contained in the repository, so everybody has the same settings.

## Publish

To make a new release to npm on `main`, run

```sh
npm run release
```

to create a change log and add a tag, then run

```sh
git push --follow-tags
```

to push the change log commit as well as its associated tag. The tag will cause GitHub Actions to build and publish a new release to npm.
